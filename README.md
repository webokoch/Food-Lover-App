Food Lover App

I created and programmed Food Lover to showcase my Front- and Backend Web Developing Skills.
It combines a lot of topics and skills I've learned so far. It's a Ruby on Rails responsive 
Web App with a PostgresQL Database, hosted on Heroku. I used Bootstrap as well custom CSS.

I used following gems and add-ons:

  Devise for authentication
  
  Pundit for authorization
  
  Simple Form to create forms
  
  Geocoder for geocoding
  
  Mapbox to display a map
  
  pg_search to search within the app
  
  Cloudinary for image uploading & hosting
  
  Heroku for web hosting
